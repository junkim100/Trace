## Technical Profile

### Primary Tech Stack
_Technologies will be learned from activity._

### Programming Languages
_Languages will be detected from activity._

### Tools & Platforms
- Trace macOS app (screen/system audio recording permissions; screenshot cache inspection)
- GitHub Issues + PLAN.md for roadmap management

### Development Environment
_Environment details will be detected._

---

## Current Focus

### Active Projects
- Trace-assisted genealogy extraction/verification workflow (including Trace prompt/feature maintenance)
- Gartz family genealogy extraction from a local copy of the Gartz family website

### Learning Goals
- Improve Trace capture reliability (macOS permissions + screenshot cache behavior) to support evidence-backed genealogy auditing

### Ongoing Tasks
_Recurring tasks will be identified._

---

## Work Patterns & Habits

### Daily Rhythms
- Often works in two short blocks (mid-afternoon and evening) rather than one continuous session

### Work Style
- Iterates in a tight loop: review evidence in browser/local files → use agent to queue audits → adjust tooling/code/docs to improve the workflow
- Works in parallel across browser, terminal, and agent instead of strictly sequential tasking
- Prioritizes verification by cross-checking genealogical facts against obituary/funeral-home sources before updating records

### Communication Patterns
_Communication patterns will be detected._

---

## Interests & Personal

### Professional Interests
- Building/maintaining agent-assisted research tooling for structured extraction and verification

### Personal Hobbies
- Genealogy research with emphasis on source verification

### Media & Entertainment
_Media preferences will be learned._

## Relationships & Network

### Key People
_Key collaborators will be identified._

### Organizations
_Organizations will be identified._

---

## Important Context

### Key Facts
- Maintains a local research folder and a local copy of the Gartz family website for crawling/extraction and evidence management

### Constraints & Considerations
_Constraints will be noted._

### Goals & Aspirations
- Create a reliable, trace-assisted pipeline for auditing genealogy data (e.g., detecting impossible dates) backed by primary/near-primary sources

---

## Behavioral Insights

### Observed Patterns
- Tooling improvements (Trace permissions/cache + prompt/feature cleanup) are treated as first-class work to increase confidence in downstream genealogy verification

### Productivity Indicators
- Combining local evidence review with agent-driven audit queues appears to accelerate identification of data issues (e.g., impossible dates) and verification steps

## Memory Log

- [2026-01-27 00:52] Jun is developing a Trace-assisted genealogy workflow, using a local copy of the Gartz family site plus obituary/record sources for verification, and iterating by improving Trace capture/prompt behavior while running agent-driven audit queues.
